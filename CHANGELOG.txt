OpenRoom 1.4 - 3/5/2012
========================================================================
-Corrected an issue that was causing room creation to fail silently when
there are no existing room groups, and also causing group deletion to
work incorrectly.
	admin/rooms.php
	admin/roomgroups.php
	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3364401&group_id=554062&atid=2248376

-Corrected an issue that was causing the day view loader to hang when
the dayviewer() function was called before the dayviewModule div was 
loaded by the browser.
	modules/calendar.php
	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3364434&group_id=554062&atid=2248376
	
-Added encoding to params string to allow special characters in usernames and passwords.
	modules/login.php
	https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3477760&group_id=554062&atid=2248376

- Added mobile interface that works similarly to the Android app created by Budi Wibowo.
*Also added buttons for user preference switch between desktop and mobile views.
	includes/jquery.min.js
	includes/mobile.php
	themes/default/mobile/header.php
	themes/default/mobile/content.php
	themes/default/mobile/footer.php*
	themes/default/mobile/style.css*
	themes/default/mobile/images/ajax-loader.gif
	index.php (small addition to carry over GET data after redirection)

- Minor update of copyright information.
*Also added buttons for user preference switch between desktop and mobile views.
	themes/default/desktop/footer.php*
	themes/default/desktop/style.php*

- Added Mobile_Detect.php and limited mobile detection to only tested
mobile devices.

	includes/Mobile_Detect.php
	includes/or-theme.php*

seeing time limit errors.
	or-reserve.php (line 88)

- Adjusted positioning of room details box to correctly display on the screen.
	modules/roomdetails.php
	http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=2248376&aid=3491062&group_id=554062


OpenRoom 1.3
========================================================================
- Corrected code in /includes/or-dbinfo.php to correctly sanitize data 
in $_POST and $_GET. Due to a mistake, the previous code was doing
nothing to arrays in these globals.
	includes/or-dbinfo.php
	


OpenRoom 1.2 - 8/27/2010
========================================================================
- Corrected code in or-getroominfo.php to accuratly return Special Hours
results. A mistake was made in the initial
	(fromrange >= FROM_UNIXTIME(". $fromrange .") AND torange <= FROM_UNIXTIME(". $torange .")
block that needed to be corrected to
	(fromrange < FROM_UNIXTIME(". $fromrange .") AND torange > FROM_UNIXTIME(". $torange .")
in order to catch all possible ranges.
(The first line would only catch special hours that occur wholly within
the day, while the second catches special hours that occur surrounding the
day, while the other OR'd statements will trigger if the special hours
occur within the day (either starting and ending, or starting, or just ending).)
	or-getroominfo.php (one line change, old line commented out)


OpenRoom 1.1 - 5/28/2010
========================================================================
- Added scrolling Room Details box so that users selecting rooms later
in the evening can still easily see which room they are mousing over.

	themes/default/desktop/style.css
	
- Added Cancellations to "On Condition" emails so that cancellation
emails can be more easily controlled.
	admin/email.php
	or-cancel.php (major changes)
	
- Fixed slowness issue when day view table was pre-loading over 1.5 MB
of javascript code.
	modules/dayview.php
