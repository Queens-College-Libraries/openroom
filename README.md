# Openroom 

This version of openroom is a work-in-progress. 
We have a lot of enhancements planned. 
The project is free and open source (GPLv3). 

## Proposed technologies 

* PHP 7.1 for a better PHP 
* PDO for database interaction 
* Twig for templating and better theme support  
* jQuery and bootstrap for front end 

Thoughts?
