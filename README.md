# Openroom 

This version of openroom is a work-in-progress. 
We have a lot of enhancements planned. 
The project is free and open source (GPLv3). 

## Proposed technologies 

* PHP 7.1 for a better PHP 
* PDO for database interaction 
* Twig for templating and better theme support  
* jQuery and bootstrap for front end 

## Proposed supported web browsers 

* Support current versions of Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox

## A demo for twig support 
Please take a look at

It is just an example to show you what I want you to be able to do with your own custom theme.
This form is not functional and likely will not be in 2018. 
This is only a demonstration of my vision.
