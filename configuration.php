//Reservation Limits
/*
 * This section includes settings for limiting users on how many or how long
 * their reservations may be.
 * There are three ways to limit users: duration, total, frequency, and window.
 * 
 * Duration
 * Limiting duration will place a limit on how long a single reservation may be.
 * Example: Users can make reservations at a maximum duration of 4 hours each.
 * Duration must be specified in minutes. 0 means there is no limit. (Not recommended.)
 * 
 * Total
 * Limiting totals will place a limit on the total amount of time that may be reserved
 * during a specified time period. The available periods are day, week, month, and year.
 * Example: Users can make any combination of reservations that total up to no more
 * than 8 hours per week.
 * Total must be specified in minutes. 0 means there is no limit.
 * 
 * Frequency
 * Limiting frequency will place a limit on how many reservations may be made during
 * a specified time period. The available periods are day, week, month, and year.
 * Example: Users can make a maximum of 6 reservations per week.
 * Frequency must be specified in maximum number of reservations. 0 means there is no limit.
 * 
 * Reservations are counted by their start date and time. So if a reservation runs
 * into the next day, it does not count for that day, only for the day it started on.
 * 
 * Window
 * The Window limit allows users to make reservations only within a certain time range.
 * This allows you to prevent users from making reservations 10 years into the future
 * that they can't fulfill. The Window range always starts at the current time, and
 * ends at either a specified date, or a dynamic duration.
 * For example, if the Window is specified to be 5/28/2010, reservations will be denied
 * after that date. If the Window is set to 7 days, reservations will be denied 7 days
 * away from the current time.
 * The Window range is specified like so: a number indicating a duration, and day, week,
 * month, or year indicating a type. When specifying a date (such as 5/28/2010), the number
 * should be 0, and the date ([m]m/[d]d/yyyy) (NO leading zeroes) should replace type.
 * Example1: array(6,"month")  The window ends 6 months from the current time.
 * Example2: array(0,"5/28/2010")  The window ends on 5/28/2010.
 * 
 * COMBINATIONS
 * If more than one of these settings is configured, combinations work thusly:
 * When a reservation is made, first the Frequency is checked, then the total, then duration.
 * If any of these checks fail, the reservation can not be made.
 * 
 * In the default values below, users may make reservations of a lengh of up to 4 hours each,
 * and may make no more than 4 hours (240) worth or reservations per day.
